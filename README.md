# surveyProject

**THE PROJECT:**
This is the final project for my grade 12 computer science course.

This program will create a survey and use sockets as well as multithreading to communicate to a client. This will allow any machine to communicate with the server machine so long as they are on the same network. Excess communication requests will be put in a buffer and will be handled after the current one.

This program shows everything with JOptionPanes as well as a basic GUI for the server-side. Frontend was not the goal of the project here so the GUI is a little rough.

**SERVER:**
In order to run the server, run main. You will be prompted to make a survey then wait for a connection from a client. Every time a client connects, you will recieve their answers.

**CLIENT:**
Run Client. You will enter an IP and then wait for a connection. After, you will answer the survey questions and the program will end.

**NOTE: BOTH MACHINES MUST HAVE ALL FILES INSTALLED**
